# Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft Control

Welcome to the Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft Control project! This project simulates the control of a lunar spacecraft, Chandrayaan 3, through a series of commands. You'll take on the role of a scientist at ISRO, tasked with developing a program that translates Earth-sent commands into spacecraft instructions.

## Overview

Chandrayaan 3 spacecraft navigates using galactic coordinates, represented by x, y, z coordinates. It starts at a specific point and facing a certain direction. The spacecraft can move forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and adjust its angle up or down based on the provided commands.

## How It Works

1. The spacecraft's initial position and direction are set.
2. A series of commands (f, b, l, r, u, d) are provided to control the spacecraft's movements and orientation.
3. The program processes the commands and updates the spacecraft's position and direction accordingly.
4. At the end of the sequence, the final position and direction of the spacecraft are displayed.

## Getting Started

1. Install any required dependencies.
2. Run the 'chanda.py' file to control the spacecraft using a predefined sequence of commands.

## Usage

Feel free to modify the 'command' list in the 'chanda.py' file to simulate different scenarios and observe how the spacecraft responds.
